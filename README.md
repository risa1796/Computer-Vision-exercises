## 1. Binary image classification - 'Smiling or Not' with face data 

#### [🙂🙁 not-/smiling face binary image classification ](https://github.com/risa1796/Computer-Vision-exercises/blob/main/Smile_or_Not-2.ipynb)

After adjusting the parameters for image augmentation I was able to slightly improve the model performance up to validation accuracy of 98%. 
Unfortunately, the test dataset has no labels added for images. So it was unable to use the test dataset.
