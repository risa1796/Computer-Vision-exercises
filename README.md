### 1. Binary image classification - 'Smiling or Not' with face data

After adjusting the parameters for image augmentation I was able to slightly improve the model performance up to validation accuracy of 98%. 
Unfortunately, the test dataset has no labels added for images. So it was unable to use the test dataset.
